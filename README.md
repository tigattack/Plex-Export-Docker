# Plex-Export-Docker

## Notice

Based on [RXWatcher/Plex-Export-Docker](https://github.com/RXWatcher/Plex-Export-Docker) and modified for my own personal use cases.

Sorry, but I have no wish to support this project or resolve issues I don't encounter myself.  
This was one of those late-night, somewhat hacky creation to solve a problem. Don't judge the quality ðŸ‘€

The repositories mentioned below have been statically included in this one to allow for quick and easy modifications. Some fixes were also copied in from [UniverseDevel's fork](https://github.com/UniverseDevel/Plex-Export).  
As a result, no fixes will be automatically included in image rebuilds.  
Probably not a worry, though, as they've not been touched in some time.

A dockerized version of [Dachande663/Plex-Export](https://github.com/Dachande663/Plex-Export) with [dpDesignz/plex-export-responsive-skin](https://github.com/dpDesignz/plex-export-responsive-skin)
